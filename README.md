# Overview

As a programmer, I would like to advance my skills in JavaScript by developing actual applications that represent core concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and data persistence. This application is the To-Do List application that allows users to dynamically add, mark complete, and delete tasks.

The aim of writing this software is to familiarize myself with key JavaScript features and enhance my coding abilities by developing an interactive and functional web application.

# Development Environment

I implemented this software in Visual Studio Code as my IDE, on Windows 10. The programming language utilized is JavaScript, with HTML and CSS for structure and design.

An external JavaScript library, dayjs, was employed to handle and format timestamps for each task added. The library was included via a CDN link.
